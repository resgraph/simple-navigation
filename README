== Simple Navigation

My modifications to the Simple Navigation gem written by Andi Schacke to allow options to be added to the link_to method call. My primary need was the ability to add the 'rel' attribute for site crawlers to obtain better results (i.e. rel='nofollow').

Simple Navigation is a ruby library for creating navigations (with multiple levels) for your Ruby on Rails application.
If you upgrade to version 2.x.x please recheck the updated documentation on http://wiki.github.com/andi/simple-navigation.
